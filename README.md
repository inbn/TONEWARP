#Tonewarp
Tonewarp is a Generative Music Game using Three.js and the Web Audio API, created for my Music Informatics BSc at the University of Sussex. 

It uses Three.js for the 3D visuals and the Web Audio API for scheduling and generating audio.

Inspirations for the game range from Erik Satie to 2001's Rez for the Sega Dreamcast.

Current goals for development include:

* Updating to the latest version of Three.js
* Refactoring pretty much everything
* Reducing the number of JS files
* Adding mobile controls
* Make something like this but better

**Disclaimer:** This code was written in early 2014 and is pretty janky
